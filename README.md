# StockTicker
Software implementation for Stock Ticker game from Canada

This is the logic to replicate the Stock Ticker game from Canada. This serves as the logic that can be used by an interface
to create the game for people to play.

This project will ultimately be a library that can be used by an interface, and it may be adapted so that it can be used on
more platforms.
